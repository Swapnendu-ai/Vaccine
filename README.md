# Vaccine
 An alarm system for vaccine availability

 Download the whole thing.
 Install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
 Double click on the vaccine.py file
 
 To add custom pincodes, open vaccine.py using a notepad. Modify this line "pincodes = [831001,831003,831004,831011,831012,831013]" in the text. I checked for 6 pincodes. You should add as many as you want (min 1). The pincodes should be separated by a ','.
 
 Change your age by rewriting 'age = 23' to your age. Yes I'm 23.
 Save the file.
 Double click on the file to run it.
 
## Features
 - It will sound an alarm when there is vaccine available
 - It will print the pincode of the location (at the top) where it is available along with other data. The pincode will be at the top.
 - It will open the cowin portal. I recommend you familiarize yourself with the portal and register yourself before hand. This way you can quickly book an appointment as soon as there is an alarm.

# Keep the program running in the background. If you close the program, the alarm will not ring.
